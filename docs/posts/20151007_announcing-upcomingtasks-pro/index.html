      <p>In case you didn't know, UpcomingTasks is the simplified way to manage your Basecamp 2 tasks when you're away from your computer.</p>
<p>I created UpcomingTasks in September 2012 out of frustration with the current offerings for managing <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp 2</a> tasks on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I <a href="https://github.com/brendanmurty/upcomingtasks">open-sourced</a> the entire project to give back to the web development community that has taught me so much over the last few years.</p>
<p>UpcomingTasks has been running consistently over the years but with a busy full-time job and social life, I never put in a solid effort to build premium paid features. That has changed over the last few months. I've been busy in my free time building some features that I hope you'll enjoy using.</p>
<h2>Pro features</h2>
<p>Current Pro features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing project details</li>
<li>Assigning tasks to other people</li>
<li>User profile images in comments</li>
<li>Time zone localisation support</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned Pro features are also listed on the UpcomingTasks Pro page.</p>
<h2>What about the free account?</h2>
<p>All current UpcomingTasks features will continue to work as they are for the life of the product. Your data will never be shared with any third-party and there will never be advertisements to get in the way.</p>
<h2>Why should I subscribe?</h2>
<p>Along with access to additional features, paying for an UpcomingTasks Pro account helps to support future development and cover ongoing maintenance costs.</p>
<h2>What if I want to cancel or pause my subscription?</h2>
<p>You're free to downgrade to a free account at any time. There is no cancellation fee. You can re-subscribe again whenever you like.</p>
<h2>How do I subscribe?</h2>
<p>Simply login to UpcomingTasks using your Basecamp account, press the <em>Upgrade</em> button in the menu and then press the <em>Subscribe to UpcomingTasks Pro</em> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
