      <p>I recently visited New York to see how <a href="https://twitter.com/ellacondon">Ella</a> was going with her studies there. I had some vague plans <em>(who wants to overplan a holiday anyway)</em> of what to see and do when I was there. This was the first time I'd visited New York and also the USA, so I had a few challenges along the way. However, these certainly weren't to do the people I met over there, who were all kind and helpful but somewhat louder than I expected.</p>
<p>I was welcomed in to the country by a very friendly airport employee at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport">LAX</a> and experienced some snow on the way in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport">JFK</a> which was pretty magical. Getting to the city via the shuttle late at night in decent levels of snow was also beautiful.</p>

<em>It was pretty cold that first night</em></p>
<p>Naturally, first on my list was a recommendation from <a href="https://twitter.com/theromulans">Brett</a> to visit a specific diner where he'd enjoyed a fine burger in the past. Specifically, this diner was named <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/3/30459/restaurant/Upper-East-Side/J-G-Melon-New-York">J.G. Melon</a>, and it was certainly worth the trek. I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger ($10.50). It was a tantalising mix of meat and cheese, perfected with a side of cottage fried potatoes. This was the first and best burger of my trip.</p>

<em>J.G. Melon, 1291 3rd Ave</em></p>
<p>As a huge fan of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a> series, I just had to visit the diner that they used for external shots in the early series. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom's_Restaurant">Tom's Restaurant</a> is located in the upper west side of the city and has become a bit of a tourist destination. Obviously, we had to see what the food was like. It wasn't very exciting really, but they still managed a decent American burger for a fair price!</p>

<p>Aside from the cheap food, there are also some pretty spectacular views in this city. One of the most surprising to me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal">Grand Central</a> terminal, which certainly lives up to it's name.</p>

<em>Largest American flag I've ever seen</em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island">Coney Island</a> was also a favourite of mine. After receiving a fair amount of damage from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, Coney Island feels almost like a ghost town.</p>

<p>Another location with some awesome views is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park">Central Park</a>, which acts as an escape from the busy city for the locals and tourists alike.</p>

<p>I'd love to return to this beautiful city in the near future, I might even plan it out a little more!</p>
