      <p>No matter what we do to avoid them, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/software-has-bugs-this-is-normal/">all software has bugs</a>.</p>
<p>Software is created by humans, who all make mistakes, get distracted, misunderstand things and lose focus. This is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Every new line of code is likely to introduce new bugs in a system. We have testing processes, but these can never guarantee a bug-free system.</p>
<p>So how should a developer react to a new bug report? I'll try to cover my general thought process below.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Information Gathering</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the impact of this bug?</li>
<li>When does this bug need to be fixed?</li>
<li>Which area(s) of the system are/is affected?</li>
<li>Is the whole system not working because of this?</li>
<li>Is the issue isolated to a certain type of user?</li>
<li>Has this issue been validated by the reporter themselves?</li>
<li>What is the process you have to go through to experience this bug?</li>
<li>What should the system do instead of what it currently does?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2: Assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do I need help with this?</li>
<li>How important is this bug?</li>
<li>Should I finish my current task or work on this bug right now?</li>
<li>Who can help me fix this bug?</li>
<li>Do I have what I need to start working on this?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make it clear you've received the bug report</li>
<li>Explain when you'll be working on fixing it</li>
<li>Give an expectation of when you think you can fix the issue</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 4: Issue Resolution</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a temporary fix can be applied, do that first. This will give you more time to work on a more robust solution in a more relaxed timeline</li>
<li>Focus on fixing the reported issue</li>
<li>Go through the process from the bug report</li>
<li>Add debugging statements through-out this process</li>
<li>Apply the least amount of change to the system that you can</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 5: Reporting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update the bug report with a high-level summary of the changes made to fix the bug</li>
<li>Ask the reporter to confirm the issue is now fixed</li>
<li>Update your technical documentation, such as code comments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 6: Reflection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assess how this bug was introduced into the system</li>
<li>How did this get through testing?</li>
<li>Should the testing process be updated to cover issues like this in the future?</li>
<li>What was learnt in the process of fixing this bug?</li>
<li>What should have been done differently to avoid this?</li>
<li>Remind yourself that all-things-considered, you have people that care for you and this bug was not the end of the world as we know it</li>
</ul>
