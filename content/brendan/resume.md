### Hamish Songsmith (Team Lead at [4mation](https://4mation.com.au))

> I was fortunate to work with Brendan at 4mation. He became an exceptionally reliable go-to dev who often went above and beyond his role leading and supporting his peers. Always hungry to learn, seeing the projects he was working on outside of his 9-5 were always interesting. One of the traits I appreciated most from Brendan was his ability to work through problems instead of letting them overwhelm him and block progress. Here's hoping our professional paths cross again.

### Brett Daniels (Lead Developer at [Solutions Outsourced](https://solutionsoutsourced.com.au))

> I have been most impressed with Brendan's passion, which goes hand in hand with his ability to listen and learn. Thanks to this, Brendan's skills have grown at an impressive rate during his employment. Brendan has developed the skill to look at tasks objectively, keeping calm under pressure while aiming to achieve the best results for clients. Brendan's eye for detail, in particular with regard to thorough planning and documentation, is also highly noteworthy.
