It's the holiday season and I've had more time to work on **UpcomingTasks**, so some improvements have been made over the last few weeks. These updates are applied automatically and all users receive them free of any charge.

### Tablet styling improvements

As I can now more appropriately test tablet designs on my new [Microsoft Surface](http://microsoft.com/surface), UpcomingTasks is now a lot easier to use on a tablet. This includes larger navigation items, improved finger-sized buttons and suitable list padding.

### Improved readability

Spacing and fonts have been updated to improve readability. Larger sizes are utilised so that you can quickly process information while using a mobile device.

### Project view

For another view of your tasks, your Basecamp 2 projects can now be viewed via the folder icon in the navigation. From here you can navigate to existing tasks and quickly add a task to a list by pressing a plus icon.
